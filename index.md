### Profile
I am a [Senior Lecturer](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/41503-leo-zhang) in the [School of ICT](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/school-information-communication-technology) and the Program Director for [Bachelor of Cybersecurity](https://www.griffith.edu.au/study/degrees/bachelor-of-cyber-security-1677), [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/). Prior to this, I was a faculty member in the [School of IT](https://www.deakin.edu.au/information-technology), [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au/) (2018-2023). I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2016. I am interested in a wide range of topics in cybersecurity,  with a particular focus on trustworthy AI and applied cryptography. 

I am a core member of the [TrustAGI Lab](https://trust-agi.github.io/), whose goal is to endow machines with human-level intelligence while ensuring  trustworthiness and transparency. I am a member of IEEE and ACM, and an Associate Editor of [IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tq). 

I am always actively looking for self-motivated students. Please email me your CV, transcript and english test score if you are interested in my research topics. Information about __Griffith PhD admission and scholarships__ can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/prosStudents).
